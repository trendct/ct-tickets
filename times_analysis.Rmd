This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Times when tickets are given in Connecticut

```{r facet-histograms, fig.width=9, fig.height=60}
c <- ggplot(incidents, aes(x=Hour))
c <- c + geom_histogram(colour="darkred",fill="white", binwidth=1)
c <- c + ggtitle("Frequency of tickets given over time in Connecticut")
c <- c + ylab("Tickets")
c
dept_histograms <- c + facet_wrap(~Department.Name,ncol=3, scales="free")  
dept_histograms
```

## Times for each district

```{r facet-histograms, fig.width=9, fig.height=60}
not_state <- subset(incidents, Department.Name!="State Police")
c <- ggplot(not_state, aes(x=Hour))
c <- c + geom_histogram(colour="darkred",fill="white", binwidth=1)
c <- c + ggtitle("Frequency of tickets given over time by Department")
c <- c + ylab("Tickets")
dept_histograms <- c + facet_wrap(~Department.Name,ncol=3, scales="free")  
dept_histograms
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
